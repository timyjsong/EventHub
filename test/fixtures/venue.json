In the event of inclement weather, we recommend quality rain gear. Umbrellas are allowed but may not be open during the performances. Smoking is prohibited except in one section to the far right of the lawn. If you have trouble walking up inclined surfaces, lawn seating may not be the best option for you. If lawn seating is your only option, please see our staff for assistance. Traffic Please plan ahead and allow for plenty of extra time in the event of heavy traffic so that you do not miss any of the earlier performances. We open the parking lots hours early to accommodate all those that want to arrive early.

Tailgating We have several parking areas and we condone and even, promote, responsible tailgating. Tailgating can be a very big part of making the event fun and memorable for you. That being said, the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, in our parking areas, actually violates a local Gilford ordinance. Underage drinking and/or intoxication, will most certainly cause you to miss the show and may lead to being arrested. Weather All performances will go on rain or shine. In the event of a weather emergency, like a hurricane, events will most likely be rescheduled. In the event of inclement weather, please use quality rain gear. Umbrellas are allowed but may not be open during performances. Umbrellas Umbrellas are allowed inside the venue and we allow all types of chairs and blankets in the lawn area. We ask that you are courteous and keep your umbrella closed during the performance to not obstruct anyone's view. We recommend wearing ponchos or other rain gear. The show will go on rain or shine.

Any weapons discovered on an individual attempting to enter the venue will be confiscated and we will not be able to return that item to you at any time. Pets There are no pets allowed anywhere on the property. Please contact the box office in advance to coordinate the use of any kind of service animal. No Re-entry Once you enter the pavilion, you will not be permitted to leave the venue and re-enter again so please be sure to bring everything you need with you the first time. Be sure to have your photo ID with you as everyone is carded for alcohol service.
